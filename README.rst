GSO : Googling Stack Overflow
=============================

This app used to exist as a working plugin for sublime text.
That code exists on the `/sublime-text` branch. The library which
was used for googling things was deprecated, and I switched
to using vim. Therefore I am rewriting this as a vim plugin to use
a different plugin.

*This plugin is not currently working, but when it does, it will be*
**awesome**. I plan to use it quite frequently, so that should
force me to maintain it and make it better.
Help is very welcome.

Checkout the latest development in the `/dev` branch.

Description
-----------

Much of the time you spend coding is Googling things,
and dumping other's code into your editor.
Wouldn't it be great if you could have that process
integrated into your environment? Or even done automatically for you?

This is the goal of GSO.
