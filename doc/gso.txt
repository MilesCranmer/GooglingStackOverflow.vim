SYNOPSIS

:GSO [(-l | --language) <language>] [-n | --no-text] [<search>...]

DESCRIPTION

                            Search Google with the query [search], find
                            the first relevant Stack Exchange result,
                            then dump the answer with the highest score
                            to the line below the cursor, in plain
                            text format. The following [flags] are 
                            available:

                            -l <language>, --language <language>

                                Set the programming language for the
                                search, if it is different than the
                                current syntax highlighting language.
                                You can check this with (:echo &ft).
                                Note that some languages (e.g., C++)
                                are mapped from a different code (for
                                C++, it is from cpp)

                                Set <language> to be 'none', 'nothing',
                                or 'no' for no language to be appended
                                to your search query.

                            -n , --no-text

                                Don't paste any of the answer text,
                                just the code.
